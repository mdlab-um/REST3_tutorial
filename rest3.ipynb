    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, the replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations combines multiple parallel simulations with different conditions, which normally can accelerate the conformational sampling, given that these parallel simulations can sample different states of interest. A representative example is the Hamiltonian replica exchange (HREX) simulation, where we can define different biased potentials for the solute, but keep the solvent untouched. This can save many replicas to use. In this note, I will introduce how we can use the GROMACS program to run the HREX simulations (such as REST3). The readers can also check out one paper and future REST3 paper for the details [1,2].\n",

    "# How to run REST3 simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The GROMACS program can be used to perform the HREX simulation by patching with the PLUMED. The basic idea is that we can create different topologies for all conditions, and then this HREX simulation can be enabled by using the -hrex flag of mdrun. The usage is almost similar to the conventional MD simulations. The REST3 simulation is one of HREX simulations, which has the following equation,\n",

    "## Step 1: create systems\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you need to know how many replicas/conditions you will use in the HREX simulation, then we should create an initial simulation state for each condition. In princple, you can create different initial states for different conditions, but also you can use the same initial state for all conditions. However, if you use the same states, then we probably need more simulation time to make systems be equilibrated. This step is the same as the MD simulation. \n",
